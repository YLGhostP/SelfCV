# 👋 Hi, I'm [Ian] [CV](https://ylghostp.github.io/SelfCV/)

I am an engineering student with a strong interest in **system-level problem solving**.  
Rather than focusing on a single technology, I enjoy **designing and integrating practical systems** that address real-world needs.

My work so far has involved combining **embedded systems, software services, and automation logic** into systems that can actually run, be tested, and improved.

---

## 🔧 Current Focus

- System-level engineering and integration  
- Building practical systems that bridge **physical devices and software services**  
- Learning how reliability, automation, and security interact in real-world systems  

I am particularly interested in **cyber-physical systems (CPS)** and enjoy exploring how different components—hardware, software, and operational constraints—come together as a whole.

---

## 🧠 Areas of Interest (Exploratory)

- Embedded systems & IoT integration  
- Automation and event-driven system design  
- Computer vision and applied deep learning (coursework & projects)  
- Robotics and system security (currently exploring and learning)

I approach these topics as part of a **broader system perspective**, rather than as isolated domains.

## 🛠 Technical Skills

### Programming Languages
- Python (data processing, scripting, system prototyping)
- C/C++ (Arduino / MCU development)
- Java (introductory OOP)

### System Integration & Automation
- Node-RED (event-driven workflows, state-based logic, system orchestration)
- MQTT-based IoT integration
- Basic REST API integration

### Embedded & Hardware
- Arduino / ESP32 development
- Breadboard prototyping
- Soldering / desoldering
- Circuit testing (multimeter, continuity and voltage checks)


## 📚 Relevant Coursework

- Computer Vision (Image Processing & Recognition)
- Deep Learning
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Embedded Systems

## 🧩 How I Like to Work

I enjoy:
- Breaking down messy real-world problems into structured systems  
- Prototyping ideas quickly and iterating through testing  
- Understanding how different parts of a system affect each other  

I value **clarity, reliability, and responsibility at the system level** over isolated technical tricks.

## 🚀 What I'm Aiming For

In the long term, I aim to grow into a **system-oriented engineer** who can design, integrate, and reason about complex systems—especially those that connect the physical world with software and services.

I believe good engineering starts with understanding the problem, not just the technology.
